# This script installs qspectrumanalyzer from source. It does not install 
# globally, but in a local directory, similar to how PyBOMBS operates. You 
# must first run the gnuradio installation:
# cd grc-install/install_scripts
# sudo ./grc_from_source.sh
#
# If you plan to run with a HackRF, you should also install this before
# running the qgrx install:
# cd grc-install/install_scripts
# ./hackrf_from_source.sh
#
# Finally, you should then open a new window and run this script in 
# place with the following commands:
# cd grc-install/install-scripts/utils
# sudo -E ./gqrx_from_source.sh
#

# These are the versions that will be installed for 3.7 and 3.8
# If you want to install a different version, change these variables
QSPEC_VERSION="v2.2.0"

# get current directory (assuming the script is run from local dir)
SCRIPT_PATH=$PWD

# get username
username=$SUDO_USER

# number of cores to use for make
