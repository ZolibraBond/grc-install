# Best practice is to create an install directory off your home, then 
# cloning the git repo as follows:
# cd
# mkdir install
# cd install
# git clone https://github.com/paulgclark/grc-install
# 
# NOTE: You should run one of the gnuradio installation scripts BEFORE
# you run this one. Recommended is grc_from_source.sh
#
# You should then run this script in place with the following commands:
# cd grc-install/install-scripts
# sudo ./grc_install_flabs_class.sh
# 
# If you run this script from another directory, you will break some
# relative path links and the install will fail.

# first get a few common functions:
source ./common/common_functions.sh

# call function to get globals: script_path, script_name, user_name, cores
get_basic_info

# check if running script as root, else exit
exit_unless_root

# check that the necessary environment vars in place, else exit
check_env_vars

# determine if we are running in developer mode
# or if we are running in deploy mode (read-only)
# check if arg been passed for this, else assume deploy mode
